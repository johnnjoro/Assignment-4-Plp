## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Waterfall:

  Good for: Projects where you know exactly what you want upfront.
  Bad for: Changing your mind mid-build; fixing big problems late.
  
Agile:
  Like: Building with Lego; small pieces, constant updates, you can change as you go.
  Good for: Projects where you're still figuring things out, and need to change often.
  Bad for: Projects needing a very strict, fixed plan; very large projects.


## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Agile:
  Good for:
    Changing stuff a lot.
    Not knowing exactly what you want.
    Making apps or websites.
 Example:
    Building with blocks, changing as you go.
    
Waterfall:
  Good for:
    Knowing exactly what you want.
    Things that need a strict plan.
    Building bridges or planes.
  Example:
    Following a recipe step-by-step.
    
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

 Quality (QA):
  How:
    Test little parts, then big parts.
    Have others check your work.
    Use computers to test.
  Why:
    No bugs = happy people.
    Good name = more trust.
    Fixing early = cheaper.
 Scope & WBS:
  Scope:
    Say exactly what the project will do.
    Stops extra stuff being added.
  WBS:
    Break the project into small tasks.
    Helps you see all the work.
    Helps you plan and track the work.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?

Why Scope is Good:
  Everyone knows what to do.
  No surprise work.
  Better plans.
  Finish on time.
  
Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):
